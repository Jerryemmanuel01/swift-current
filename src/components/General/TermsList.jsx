              of software ledger entry translation between the user and
              swiftcurrent, i.e. all transactions processed by swiftcurrent
              are two-party transactions. You are prohibited from using

              any other parties. For the avoidance of doubt, you must be the

          </h2>
          <div className=" pt-2 text-xs md:text-sm tracking-wide leading-6 md:leading-7 text-gray">
            Cryptocurrency and digital assets are highly experimental and risky.
            swiftcurrent's service attempts to provide accurate price and
            exchange rate information, but this information is highly volatile
            and can change quickly without users necessarily being aware of
            these changes. For normal orders (i.e., all orders except "Precise
            Amount" orders), the exchange rate you receive is calculated at the
            time your payment is accepted. Due to varying security between
            blockchains, your payment is typically considered "accepted" at one
            block confirmation. swiftcurrentmay occasionally accept a payment
            with zero confirmations, though this decision is at swiftcurrent's
            sole discretion. It is important to note that a payment being
            broadcast to the blockchain network does not constitute an
            acceptance by swiftcurrent of that payment. Users who are sensitive
            to the exchange rate they receive should use swiftcurrent's
            "Precise Amount" feature, which guarantees an exchange rate for a
            specified period of time. The user's payment must be received and
            accepted by swiftcurrent within that period in order to receive the
            guaranteed exchange rate. You may contact customer support for more
            information on exchange rates.

            swiftcurrent only accepts one deposit per transaction ID ("TXID").
            If your funds are deposited in a TXID with more than one deposit,
            you will need to contact support to receive a refund. The exchange
            rate will not be honored and your exchange will not be completed.
            User deposits to swiftcurrent that do not confirm within 48 hours
            of being detected will be cancelled. Refund requests will be honored
            after the deposit is confirmed on the blockchain.

            swiftcurrent respects the privacy of its users by not requesting
